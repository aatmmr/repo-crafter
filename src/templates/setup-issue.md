## üîí Security & Best Practices

### Branch Protection
We recommend setting up branch protection for your main branch:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
2. Add a branch protection rule for `main` (or your default branch)
3. Enable:
   - Require a pull request before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require conversation resolution before merging
   - Include administrators

### Repository Security Settings
- Enable **vulnerability alerts** in Settings ‚Üí Security & analysis
- Consider enabling **Dependabot alerts** for dependency updates
- Set up **code scanning** if this will contain source code

### Access Management
- Review collaborator access levels regularly
- Use teams for group permissions when possible
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## üìù Best Practice Policy Example

### Code Review Policy
```markdown
## Code Review Requirements

### All Changes Must:
1. **Have a Pull Request** - No direct commits to main branch

3. **Have Peer Review** - At least one approved review required
4. **Include Tests** - New features must include appropriate tests
5. **Update Documentation** - Changes should include relevant documentation updates

### Review Guidelines:
- Focus on code quality, security, and maintainability
- Check for proper error handling and edge cases
- Verify adherence to coding standards and conventions
- Ensure changes align with project architecture

### Security Considerations:
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data

## Issue Management Policy

### Issue Requirements:
- Use descriptive titles and clear descriptions

### Branch Naming Convention:
- `feature/issue-number-short-description`
